            Rajinikanth is not just a name, he’s a phenomenon. He doesn’t wear a watch—he decides what time it is. When he walks into a room, even gravity pauses to salute. His style is so fast that light asks him for directions. And when he’s done with a file, even the Recycle Bin doesn’t dare to store it. That’s the legend of Rajinikanth — where logic ends and style begins.
